# Changelog

## 1.0.0-rc.1

- Completes the planned client-only module set, local configuration stores,
  ClickGUI/HUD foundations, and release-candidate checks.
- Adds deterministic release packaging with dependency reporting and SHA-256
  checksums.
- Adds source-style and client-only/no-external-network architecture checks to
  the normal Gradle `check` lifecycle and CI.
- Documents the performance, crash-isolation, migration, security, and manual
  release validation required before a final 1.0 tag.

This is a release candidate. Run the documented manual smoke checks before
publishing a final release and use only on servers whose rules permit client
modifications.
